# Installing

* Run `yarn install` from a command line
* This shouldn't happen, but if you get something like `yarn command not found` run `npm install -g yarn`
* Run `yarn run start` from a command line to start the application
* The application will start with a dev server that automatically updates upon saving changes
* The main code is located in `src/index.tsx`
* Ignore all the other files
